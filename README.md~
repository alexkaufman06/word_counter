Word Counter

By: Alex Kaufman

Word counter is a simple website built with ruby and Sinatra that allows
the user to see how many words are in a sentence or multiple sentences.  I
structured the code to ignore periods, commas, question marks, and exclamation
points in the sentences.  So if the user is trying to find how many times
"dog!" appears in the sentence, it will not count correctly.  I figured this
would not be a common occurence so chose to keep the code this way.

This is my first solo assessment at Epicodus.
